The second home (1570 sq. ft.) is a gardener's dream complete with two bedrooms and two full bathrooms. To the left of the house is the grape arbor where you can rest and dream while watching watching the grapes soak in the sun. Inside the house, there is plenty of space to entertain while enjoying the beauty of nature. The bathroom connected to the dining room is done entirely out of cedar by the original owner! The details are delightful and must be seen personally to be truly appreciated.
